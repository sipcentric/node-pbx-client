# WebRTC Softphone

A basic example of a softphone, built using the Sipcentric PBX Client (`@sipcentric/pbx-client`).

## Usage

First, you'll need to edit `src/components/App/component.jsx` and enter your Sipcentric username and password where prompted in `componentDidMount()`.

Next, install and start the app.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open your browser to `localhost:3000` and you should see the softphone, and it should be ready to use!

For more information on how to interact with the Sipcentric PBX Client, take a look at the project on GitHub.
