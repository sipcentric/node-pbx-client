# Presence Example

A basic example of how to use presence.

## Usage

Add your Sipcentric username and password to `config.js`, and set your `customerId` in `index.js`.

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

You should see a list in your terminal of all extensions on your customer, and their current presence state.
