# Presence Example

A basic example of how to use presence.

## Setup config file
Add your Sipcentric username, password, and customerId to a new file named `config.js`.  See config.example.js
for reference.

## Install dependencies and run the script
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

You should see a list in your terminal of all extensions on your customer, and their current presence state.
